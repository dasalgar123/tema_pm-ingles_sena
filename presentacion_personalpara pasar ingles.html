        <h1>Presentación de Daniel Andrés Salinas Garavito</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Daniel Andrés Salinas Garavito, and I was born in the city of Cúcuta. I am a person guided by good values and principles. I recognize that I have both virtues and flaws, and I am working on them. However, there is something I don’t like: often, people do not accept the truth when it is presented to them. I admit that sometimes I find it hard to face certain realities, but I will never be hypocritical; I will always be sincere.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my interactions with others, I have two ways of behaving: I treat those who treat me well as I would treat my mother, but if someone tries to deceive me or treats me poorly, I react differently. In other words, my behavior reflects how I am treated. Additionally, I focus more on the values of individuals rather than their social status, physical appearance, or economic situation. I firmly believe that what truly matters are the qualities and principles of each person, not their appearance or wealth.
